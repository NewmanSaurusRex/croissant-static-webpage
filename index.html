        Fact: There is <em>No So Thing</em> as a Yummy Gluten-Free Croissant 🥐
      </h1>
      <p>
        Gluten is a 💪 protein 💪 found in wheat, rye and barley plants. It is
        naturally occurring, but it can also be extracted, concentrated and
        added to food (and other products) as a protein supplement, to create
        varied textures and/or flavors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Gluten also works as a binding agent to hold processed foods together
        and give them shape. The structure of a 🥐croissant🥐 depends on gluten!
        When wheat flour is mixed with water, gluten proteins chemically react
        to create the croissant's perfect buttery, flaky consistency!
